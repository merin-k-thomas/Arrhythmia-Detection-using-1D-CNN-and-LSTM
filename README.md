# Arrhythmia-Detection-using-1D-CNN-and-LSTM
The aim of this work is based on 1D-CNN layers and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for the detection of arrhythmia.

Arrhythmia is caused by electrical dysfunction, which can affect heart shape or disrupt the heart rate. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important diagnostic tool in cardiology for determining and analysis of cardiac conditions of patients most especially life-threatening heart diseases and abnormalities such as arrhythmias. ElectroCardioGraphy (ECG), that is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart. A patient with arrhythmia can feel their heartbeat racing, fluttering or skipping more or like palpitation. The symptoms are shortness of breath, fainting, lightheadedness, chest pain or even no symptoms at all. There are three major types of arrhythmias: Bradycardia (slow), Irregular or Extra heartbeat, Tachycardia (rapid).

Data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database were used in this study. The database contains 48 recordings, each containing two 30-min ECG lead signals. In agreement with the AAMI recommended practice, the four recordings containing paced beats were removed from the analysis.
